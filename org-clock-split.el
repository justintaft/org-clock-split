;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  This package provides ability to split an org CLOCK entry into two records.
;;
;;  Usage example:
;;
;;  If cursor is on
;;
;;  CLOCK: [2018-08-30 Thu 12:19]--[2018-08-30 Thu 16:05] =>  3:46
;;  
;;  Running
;;
;;  (org-clock-split \"1h2m\")
;;  
;;  Will produce
;;
;;  CLOCK: [2018-08-30 Thu 12:19]--[2018-08-30 Thu 13:21] =>  1:02
;;  CLOCK: [2018-08-30 Thu 13:21]--[2018-08-30 Thu 16:05] =>  2:44"
